# sliding-scorer-project
* the project is an improvement on the ipc (industrial production certificate,a token) system of Axis & Allies (board game)
## why I want to do the project
* 1. 40 position for ipc tokens are not sufficient
* 2. easy to knock the token down
* 3. token belong to different coutries may overlap
## the structure of the scorer
### main body
* wooden body structure(rectangular cube)
* track is inside the wooden body__every country has its own track__60 ipc position for each country,separated into 2 row,the track is in the middle of them
### track and slider(pointer)
* plan 1: slider is attached to the C shaped accessory that move along the T shaped track(not really aesthetically pleasing)
* plan 2: slider is attached to the T shaped ancessory that move along the c shaped track (need larger space)
